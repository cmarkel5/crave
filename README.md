##General Assembly Web Development Immersive (WDI) - Fall 2014, Project 3
</br>

##Overview
Crave is a web application that allows users to quickly shop for new tech products at an introductory discount. A unique feature of the app is that the user must decide within 30 seconds whether or not they "crave" the product by either purchasing or declining the product within the allotted time. 

Currently, Crave leverages the Wal-Mart API to source technology products. We chose the Wal-Mart API since there wasn't a new technology API available and because we wanted a more robust backend as compared to seeding the database.

Crave was developed for a project for the Fall 2014 Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. It was developed over a week-long sprint to model the agile software development process. For your reference, the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cmarkel5/crave).
